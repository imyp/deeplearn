The goal of this project is to implement and train a [transformer][transformer-pdf]. In order to implement a transformer there are some more fundamental concepts that should be understood. This includes understanding of [normalization layers][layernorm-pdf], [residual networks][resnet-pdf], and [batch normalization][batchnorm-pdf].
